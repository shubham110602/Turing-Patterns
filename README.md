# Turing-Patterns

Dataset - Turing patterns in differential equations describe how chemical components interact with one another under the guidance of reaction-diffusion equations to produce intricate spatial patterns. These equations, which are often represented as partial differential equations (PDEs), explain how the concentrations of interacting substances vary over time due to diffusion and reaction processes. By using differential diffusion rates and nonlinear reaction kinetics, among other conditions, Alan Turing's seminal study revealed that stable spatial patterns such as spots, stripes, or spirals can self-organize from initially uniform concentrations. Chemical kinetics, computational modeling, and developmental biology can all benefit from this mathematical paradigm. It not only bridges the gap between chemistry and mathematics but also offers profound insights into the origins of patterns in the natural world. There are 3 types of patterns - Spirals, Spots and Strips.
